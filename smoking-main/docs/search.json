    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe study is motivated by researchers’ interest in the potential association between smoking and health-related issues. The Surgeon General’s report - Smoking and Health - in 1964 is one of the earliest official report on the health consequences of smoking in the United States [1]. In this report, well-known health risks associated with smoking, for example, lung cancer, coronary heart disease, and emphysema. The study has shaped public attitude and policy regarding smoking. In 1969, advertising for cigarette on television and radio was banned. Researches have been conducted on the 50 years after the report, further suggesting tobacco-use has a positive correlation with heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer [2].\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is another landmark event on the history of human health. While smoking compromises lung function, the COVID-19 also primarily affects the lungs [3]. According to WTO, smokers are more vulnerable to the pandemics than non-smokers.\nHow does the health risks associated with smoking changed, beside diseases related to lung? In this research, we will study the household smoking data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemics, which will help us to identify latest health risks associated with smoking and hint on the pandemics’ impact on smoking issues.\nThroughout this study, our majority concern is to identify health-condition issues associated with smoking during the COVID-19 pandemics and to assess potential shifts in the smoking-caused health issues during the pandemics by comparing our observations with previous study [2]. To make the comparison fair, we consider only data collected in the United States, as used in the previous study."

NHANES is a major project of the National Center for Health Statistics (part of the CDC), and became a continuous project since 1999. The survey upadtes every year and contains records from 5000 people national wide.\nWe focus on the three questionnaire: Smoking - Cigarette Use, Smoking - Household Smokers, and Medical Conditions. Due to the Covid-19, data from cycle 2019-2020 is not completed and thus the department combine 2017-2018 with 2019-2020 to form a new version of data from 2017-2020, which is the latest version of data.

This question has been studied for years and has several well-known results like smoking will increase the risk for lung cancer. In out study, we would like examine the influence of smoking to health condition comprehensively, including its effect to heart, liver, etc. We are especially interested in discovering the relation between smoking to health problems that are not thought to be related to smoking in general.\nTo achieve this goal, we would like to use various visualization method including mosaic plot and histogram by condition to see if there are any apparant relations. We also want to use pearson correlation with heatmap visualization to measure the relation between smoking to different health benchmarks.\nAfter this, we plan to find the effect of secondhand smoke exposure to health conditions. Secondhand smoke exposure is nowadays a common phenomenon, but people tend to oversee this problem compared to the direct influence by cigarette. Therefore, we would like to repeat the procedure as before but change the smoking variable to secondhand smoke exposure to find its possible effect to one’s health condition."

Most people having one disease does not have a second disease.

Since the ten dependent disease features share the same set of labels, we combine them into a general health-condition feature, where “yes” stands for “having disease”, “no” for “not having disease”, and “unk” for “not knowing if having disease.” The modified data reflects the true proportion of health condition since the total number of observations for each disease feature is the same.\nFrom the general mosaic, we conclude that the majority respondent have no disease. Among respondents who have diseases, most people are daily smokers, or have one smoker (not including the respondent) at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Mosaic plot for each disease\nA faceted mosaic plot is drawn to study the data proportions for each disease and to check whether Simpson’s paradox exists. From the plots, we observe that daily smokers and non-smokers have the highest proportion of having diseases. On MCQ160P, daily smokers take a greater proportion of people having disease; on MCQ220 and MCQ550, non-smokers are the majority. Also, a larger proportion of respondents in households with one or more smokers have disease, in comparison with the proportion of respondents in households with no smoker. The previous observations are generally supported, so the Simpson’s paradox does not exist.\nThe faceted plot provide additional insights on each disease. For example a small proportion of respondents have MCQ160C, and little variation is observed from group to group. Therefore, MCQ160C may not have a significant association with smoking exposure."

For these three categories, the number of respondents smoke daily and have had the disease is much higher than the number of respondents do not smoke daily and have had the disease.\n\n\nCode\n#bar chart\nggplot(data_direct, aes(fill=Disease, x=Smoking_exposure)) + \n  geom_bar(position='fill') +\n  facet_wrap(~Disease_type) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set2\") +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(x = 'Count', y = 'Smoking Member in House', title = 'Stacked Bar-chart in Proprtion: Smoking Frequency')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe regenerate the bar chart and set the y-axis scale as proportion. This will eliminate the disturbing of the imbalanced data (the number of people smoking daily in this survey is much higher than the number of respondents smoking sometimes or no). According to the stacked bar-chart, the proportion of getting MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB, is higher for the group of respondents smoking daily. We thus conclude that smoking frequency has positive effect to the probability of gettingCOPD, emphysema, and ChB.\n\n\n3.3.2 Secondhand smoking exposure\n\n\nCode\n#bar chart\nggplot(data_second, aes(fill=Disease, x=Smoking_exposure)) + \n  geom_bar(position='stack') +\n  facet_wrap(~Disease_type) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set2\") +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(x = 'Count', y = 'Smoking Member in House', title = 'Stacked Bar-chart: Secondhand Smoking Exposure')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe focus on the influence of secondhand smoking exposure to the probability of having certain disease. The secondhand smoking exposure is measure by the reported number of respondents smoking at home. We find that the influence of secondhand smoking exposure is noticeable for MCQ010-asthma, MCQ160A-arthritis, MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB, and MCQ220-cancer or malignancy. For these three categories, the number of respondents have had the disease and one or more family members smoke at home is much higher than the number of respondents have had the disease and zero family member smoke at home.\n\n\nCode\n#bar chart\nggplot(data_second, aes(fill=Disease, x=Smoking_exposure)) + \n  geom_bar(position='fill') +\n  facet_wrap(~Disease_type) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set2\") +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(x = 'Count', y = 'Smoking Member in House', title = 'Stacked Bar-chart in Proportion: Secondhand Smoking Exposure')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe regenerate the bar chart and set the y-axis scale as proportion as before. According to the stacked bar-chart, the proportion of getting MCQ160A-arthritis and MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB, are much higher for the group of respondents that one or more family members smoke at home. For other diseases, there are also small increasings in proportions when comparing the group of respondents that one or more family members smoke at home with the group of respondents that have zero family members smoke at home. We thus conclude that secondhand exposure will increase the probability of getting disease in general, and is especially influential to arthritis and COPD, emphysema, ChB."

The Cleveland Dot plot allows us to visualize the differences in number of answers among different diseases categories.\n\n3.4.1 Smoking frequency\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the number of answer ‘yes’ in MCQ160A-arthritis and MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB, is significantly higher compared to other diseases for the group of respondents smoking daily. For MCQ160A, the proportion of ‘yes’ is high for all three smoking exposure groups, whereas for MCQ160P, the proportion of ‘yes’ is high only for the group of respondents smoking daily. Thus we make conclusion that probability of getting MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB will be influenced by smoking frequency. This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion from Bar-chart.\n\n\n3.4.2 Secondhand smoking exposure\n\n\nCode\ndata_second %&gt;%\n  count(Disease_type, Disease, Smoking_exposure) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = Disease_type)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = Disease)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Smoking_exposure) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Set2\") +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(x = 'Count', y = 'Disease type', title = 'Cleveland Dot: Secondhand Smoking Exposure')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the number of answer ‘yes’ in MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB, is significantly higher compared to other diseases for the group of respondents that there is one or more family member smoking at home. Besides, the proportion of ‘yes’ is higher compared to the group of respondents that there is zero family member smoking at home for MCQ160P. Thus we make conclusion that probability of getting MCQ160P-COPD, emphysema, ChB will be influenced by secondhand exposure. This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion from Bar-chart, but it is not clear that whether there is a general influence of secondhand exposure to probability of getting disease by analyzing this Clevelard dot plot."

    "text": "In this study, we examine the association between smoking exposure and health-related issues in the United States. To facilitate comparisons with previous studies mentioned in the Introduction, we use data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from over 5000 people around the nation. We combined three datasets to study the association between ten health-related issues and both first-handed and second-handed smoking exposure. After exploring the combined dataset, we drop columns with too many missing values and redundant features. The remained dataset has two smoke-related features, or the independent features, and ten health-related issues, or the dependent features.\nFor first-handed smoking exposure, we explore the smoking frequency. For second-handed smoking exposure, we examine the number of smokers (except the questionnaire-respondent) in the respondent’s household. For the ten health-related issues, we focus on diseases. Some selected diseases - include stroke, coronary heart disease, and cancer - were recognized as smoking-related issues in previous studies.\nAfter applying multiple data visualization techniques, as shown in the Results section, we arrive at the following conclusions: both first-handed and second-handed smoking exposures has an influence on people’s health condition in the United States, and the influences are similar for the two independent features. Smoking exposure has positive correlation with getting asthma, arthritis, COPD, emphysema, and ChB: the proportion of people who smoke daily or have more smokers in household is larger than that of people who do not smoke that often or have fewer smokers in household. On the other hand, the association between smoking exposure and coronary heart disease is not explicit: contradicts the previous studies.\nA possible cause of the contradiction could be the lag of effect of smoking: if a person start to smoke and smoke daily, he or she may not have a health-related issue related to smoking. This pattern could be related to people’s age. In future studies, we will further explore the impact of people’s age and how many years they smoke. Despite this abnormality, our study conforms with the previous ones: that is, both first-handed and second-handed smoking exposures has an association with health-related issues in the United States."
